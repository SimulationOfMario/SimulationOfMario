- ✒ Programming languages that I learned in order:
    - 1️⃣ | C++        : To learn the basics of programming, but I must learn its full potential
    - 2️⃣ | Java       : To learn OOP and concurrence, it is the language that I have seen the most of it
    - 3️⃣ | Haskell    : To learn functional programming and data structures, I am currently learning it in depth
    - 4️⃣ | C          : To learn pointers, code in Linux for the first time and learn a language that allows low-level control
    - 5️⃣ | C#         : To learn specially for game design
