# 🎇 Welcome, I’m @SimulationOfMario 🎇
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in Game Design
- 📖 I'm studying Software Engineering at [ETSI, UMA](https://www.uma.es/etsi-informatica/)
- 💜 My other half is [@PaulaAtencia](https://github.com/PaulaAtencia)
# 📚 What I'm currently learning on my own 📚
- 🧮 Reading [Real World Haskell Book](https://book.realworldhaskell.org/)
- ⚙ [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (because I'm moving on from Unity) 
# 🧠 Programming languages that I learned in order 
- 1️⃣ | C++        : To learn the basics of programming, but I must learn its full potential
- 2️⃣ | Java       : To learn OOP and concurrence, it is the language that I have seen the most of it
- 3️⃣ | Haskell    : To learn functional programming and data structures, I am currently learning it in depth
- 4️⃣ | C          : To learn pointers, code in Linux for the first time and learn a language that allows low-level control
- 5️⃣ | C#         : To learn specially for game design
# 🤔 I'm interested in learning this other languages:
- 💧 Lua
- 👑 Nim
